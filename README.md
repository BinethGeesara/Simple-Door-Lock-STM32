# Simple-Door-Lock-STM32
A simple yet robust **door lock controller** project using the **STM32 microcontroller**, **L293D motor driver**, and a **12V automotive central locking actuator**. It supports **open/close control via external buttons**, with **debounced interrupt handling** and **latched LED light control** based on the door state.

## üîß Features

- üß† **Interrupt-driven door open/close control** (via EXTI)  
- üîÑ Uses **L293D** H-Bridge driver to operate 12V actuator  
- üîí Latching **light indication system** to reflect lock state  
- üßπ **Debounce logic** to prevent false triggering  
- üö´ Ignores conflicting inputs (open & close pressed together)  
- üïπÔ∏è Manual control using physical push buttons

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Used

| Component                 | Description                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **STM32F103C8T6 / F401** | ARM Cortex-M MCU                            |
| **L293D**                | Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver (12V rated)      |
| **12V Actuator Motor**   | Car central locking motor                   |
| **Push Buttons**         | For Open / Close control (w/ pull-down)     |
| **LEDs**                 | Status indicators (locked / unlocked state) |
| **Power Supply**         | 12V source for actuator + 3.3V for logic    |

## üì¶ Pin Mapping

| GPIO Pin | Function              |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `PA10`   | Motor IN1 (Open)      |
| `PA11`   | Motor IN2 (Close)     |
| `PA8`    | LED 1 (Light ON)      |
| `PA9`    | LED 2 (Light ON)      |
| `PB4`    | Open Button (EXTI)    |
| `PB5`    | Close Button (EXTI)   |

## üß† Software Logic

- When **Open** button is pressed:
  - `PA10 = HIGH`, `PA11 = LOW` ‚Üí door opens  
  - Light turns **ON** (`PA9 = HIGH`)  
  - Motor stops after delay  
- When **Close** button is pressed:
  - `PA10 = LOW`, `PA11 = HIGH` ‚Üí door closes  
  - Light turns **OFF**  
- If both buttons are pressed ‚Üí command is ignored  
- **Debouncing** uses `HAL_GetTick()` and a 100ms delay threshold
